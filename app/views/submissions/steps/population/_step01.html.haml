    The TNDH mapping population was developed by Prof. Jinling Meng, at the Huazhong Agricultural University,
    Wuhan, China in collaboration with Prof. Ian Bancroft at JIC as part of the EU-funded IMSORB project.
    This population is derived from an F1 cross between Tapidor, a European Winter B. napus variety, and Ningyou7,
    a Chinese semi-Winter B. napus line. These parents were selected on the basis of their genetic dissimilarity,
    being the most divergent lines identified using RFLP markers (Meng et al., 1996) and for their contrasting
    trait characteristics and cultivation ranges.
