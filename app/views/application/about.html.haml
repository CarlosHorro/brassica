  %p.text-long
    %strong The Brassica Information Portal
    is a web repository for population and trait
    scoring information related to the Brassica breeding community. It provides
    information about quantitative trait loci and links curated Brassica phenotype
    experimental data with genotype information stored in external data sources.
    Advanced data submission capabilities and APIs enable users to store
    and publish their own study results in our Portal. The repository can be easily
    browsed thanks to a set of user-friendly query interfaces.
