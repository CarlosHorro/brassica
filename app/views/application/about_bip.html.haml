  .h2.page-title About Brassica Information Portal

  %p.text-long
    %strong The Brassica Information Portal
    is a web repository for population and trait
    scoring information related to the Brassica breeding community. It provides
    information about quantitative trait loci and links curated Brassica phenotype
    experimental data with genotype information stored in external data sources.
    Advanced data submission capabilities and APIs enable users to store
    and publish their own study results in our Portal. The repository can be easily
    browsed thanks to a set of user-friendly query interfaces.

  %p.text-long
    BIP Portal follows our
    = link_to 'Terms of Use', 'http://www.earlham.ac.uk/terms-use'
    rules, so please check these when interested in using our service.

  %h4 Manuals and training

  %p.text-long
    Most of operations at BIP is explained through context-sensitive help.
    In addition, detailed manuals explaining use of submission wizards are available below:
    %ul
      %li= link_to 'Population Submission','/manuals/upload_population_submission.pdf'
      %li= link_to 'Trial Submissions','/manuals/upload_trial_submission.pdf'

  %p.text-long
    From the home page you may access a separate section dedicated to the
    = link_to t('menu.api'), navbar_menu[:api]
    where you find all information needed to write your own calls for programmatic data upload
    and retrieval.

  %p.text-long
    We have organised number of practical training courses on using the BIP.
    All slides, hands-on tutorial and test data sets are available on
    = link_to 'github','https://github.com/TGAC/BIP_training'
    for you to follow in your own pace.
    Do not hesitate getting in touch should you have question regarding the tutorial content or beyond.

  %h4 Feedback

  %p.text-long
    If you have any feedback or question about the BIP, please contact us at
    = link_to 'contact address', 'mailto:bip_address', class: 'email-link'

  %h4 Licensing

  %p.text-long
    Submitters are responsible to adhere with data policies of his/her institution or company.
    By default, submitted data falls under the
    = succeed ',' do
      = link_to 'CC BY 4.0 license','https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/'
    to ensure maximal re-use potential,
    while the data generator or submitter needs to be accredited. This is in accordance to the BBSRC,
    which has funded this infrastructure. Submitters can state their license preferences in the
    comments section during submission. If this is not explicitly done, the CC BY 4.0 license applies.
    BIP also hosts some historical data before BIP was setup. Please refer to the individual projects for
    license information.

  %p.text-long
    Everyone can access publicly available data from BIP without an account. We encourage everyone
    reusing data to contact the data generator or submitter (this should be available in the metadata).
    In any case, it is compulsory to acknowledge data generator or submitter in any resulting publication.

  %h4 Source Code licensing

  %p.text-long
    The database itself is open source under the
    = link_to 'GPLv3','https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html'
    license and is available on
    = succeed '.' do
      = link_to 'github','https://github.com/TGAC/brassica'
    We kindly ask any party that wishes to deploy a copy (modified or not) of BIP on their own servers,
    to contact us at
    = succeed '.' do
      = link_to 'contact address', 'mailto:bip_address', class: 'email-link'
    According to the license, contacting us is not a legally binding requirement, but it aims to help measure
    the software impact and stay in contact with users for continuous software improvement.

  %h4 Authentication

  %p.text-long
    Login for submission is managed by an external oauth service, ORCiD. If you already have an
    ORCiD id, you can use it to access every functionality (submission and analysis) of the Portal.

  %h4 Data and metadata types we accept

  %p.text-long
    We currently accept Brassica Crop trial and population (meta)data. Submitting population or
    trial data via the submission web interface, we ask for metadata to be filled into fields provided
    during several submission steps. Your data can be submitted using the automatically generated .csv templates
    that will vary depending on the metadata information you put in during previous steps. Using the api, we also
    accept input data and metadata in .json format. Please see the
    = link_to t('menu.api'), navbar_menu[:api]
    for more information.  We also have a
    = link_to 'ruby client','https://github.com/TGAC/brassica/tree/master/public/client_example'
    which helps with automatised API-based submissions of population or trial data, reading from a spreadsheet.
    You still need to provide metadata
    within the client script. How to do this is described in the manual for population submission.

  %p.text-long
    During the wizard-based submissions, we are trying to provide content examples for each submission
    field. Every field content is also further described in the API documentation.
    However, if you have any questions, contact us at
    = succeed '.' do
      = link_to 'contact address', 'mailto:bip_address', class: 'email-link'

  %h4 Data and metadata standards

  %p.text-long
    We are putting a lot of effort into use of controlled vocabularies, ontologies and adherence to minimal requirements.
    For traits, we are developing the Brassica trait ontology
    = succeed ',' do
      = link_to '(BRATO)','https://github.com/Brassica-Trait-Ontology/brato'
    which adheres to
    = link_to 'CropOntology','http://www.cropontology.org/'
    standards. If you want to contribute, please do so!
    We currently use
    = link_to 'Plant','http://archive.gramene.org/plant_ontology/'
    and
    = link_to 'Trait Ontology','http://archive.gramene.org/db/ontology/search?id=TO:0000387'
    as reference ontologies for plants and
    = link_to 'GR_tax ontology','http://archive.gramene.org/db/ontology/search?id=GR_tax:017502'
    to cover Brassica taxonomy. Marker sequences are currently cross-referenced with resources such as
    = link_to 'Genebank (NCBI)','https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra'
    and
    = link_to 'EnsemblPlants','http://plants.ensembl.org/index.html'
    where possible, which will be expanded in the future.

  %h4 Citing data from BIP

  %p.text-long
    Your submitted data can be assigned a DOI after a
    %strong one week grace period.
    To the DOI-assigned data, the same license is applied as for BIP hosted data.
    As we cannot assign DOIs ourselves, we use ZENODO as an external service to assign DOIs.
    In compliance with
    = succeed ',' do
      = link_to 'DataCite', 'https://www.datacite.org/'
    a stable copy of the submission is then hosted on ZENODO.
    Please read more information about licensing in the section above.
