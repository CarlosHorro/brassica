          Further contextual help will be provided at each step of analysis setup.
          Only you will have access to the results produced by the analysis.

          The following process allows you to perform
          <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study'
          target='_blank' title='Genome-wide association study'><b>GWAS</b></a>
          on data you submit. You will need to provide genotype and phenotypic trait
          data for the analysis.<br/>

      genotype_data_file_help: |
        Genotype data needs to be provided in one of two accepted formats -
        <a href='http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/' title='Variant Call Format'>VCF</a> or
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values' title='Comma-separated values'>CSV</a>.<br/>
        <br/>
        Unlike VCF, the CSV format itself does not exactly determine how the
        data should be formatted. As such, we provide a
        <a href='%{template_url}'><b>downloadable template</b></a> showing expected
        data layout:<br/>
        <br/>
        <ul>
          <li>First column of the CSV file is an ID column. Values in this column denote sample
          identifiers</li>
          <li>Each following column is associated with a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism' title='Single-nucleotide polymorphism'>SNP</a>. Value in the header row
          identifies the SNP, whereas values in subsequent rows denote if a sample is affected (2),
          not affected (1) or the information is missing (0 or NA).</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        Low quality or irrelevant data should be filtered out of the VCF file before it
        is uploaded.

      phenotype_data_file_help: |
        Phenotype data needs to be provided in a CSV file formatted as shown by a
        <a href='%{template_url}'><b>template</b></a>:<br/>
        <br/>
        <ul>
          <li>First column of the CSV file is an ID column. Values in this column denote sample
          identifiers</li>
          <li>Each following column is associated with a phenotypic trait. Value in the header row
          identifies the trait, whereas subsequent rows contain values measured in
          sampled plants.
        </ul>
