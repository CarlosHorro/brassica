        You will also be able to provide
        data ownership and provenance information. Once successfully submitted, the
        data will be accessible for all users of the Portal. Further contextual help
        will be provided at each of the following steps:
      population: |
        The following process allows you to submit a detailed description of your
        Brassica population. Apart from species information you may indicate
        the parent Brassica lines and the list of (possibly new) plant lines
        connected with this population.
      trial: |
        With Trail submission you are able to upload new trait scoring information to BIP.
        The process lets you describe trial conditions and environment, to indicate
        what traits were scored and how, and finally to upload the list of scoring.
